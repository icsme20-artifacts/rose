We apply for two badges.

* Available: We make all of our methodological data (interview guide) and results (literature analysis, interview data) publicly (Zenodo) available. We also added notes that help to track the data to the paper. We registered a DOI (10.5281/zenodo.3972404) on Zenodo, but to be able to update the files if needed, we have not yet published the dataset on Zenodo.
* Reusable: Providing the interview guide, we enable other researchers to reuse and replicate our study.
