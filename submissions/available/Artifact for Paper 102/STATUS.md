We apply for two badges.

* Available: We make all of our methodological data (survey template, experiments) and results publicly (Zenodo) available. We registered a DOI (10.5281/zenodo.3972411) on Zenodo, but to be able to update the files if needed, we have not yet published the dataset on Zenodo.
* Reusable: Providing the survey template and code examples, we enable other researchers to reuse and replicate our study.
