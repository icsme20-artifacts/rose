We apply for the **Available** and **Reusable** badges.

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/shaker-project/shaker contains the developed software, all data for the evaluated subjects, and the scripts for analyzing such data. We also provide instructions for running the tool on new apps, different from those evaluated in the paper.

Moreover, we have registered a DOI in Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.3976330), which we will also update with the dataset and software, once the review process is completed, since we can't change files after publishing it.
