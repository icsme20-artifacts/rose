We apply for Reusable and Available.

We provide the database containing every feature used as well as the repositories at the time of mining (https://hdl.handle.net/21.11101/0000-0007-D827-A), extraction tool (https://github.com/atrautsch/Gierlappen), extracted raw data (https://hdl.handle.net/21.11101/0000-0007-E7D1-8) and finally the juptyter notebooks for building and evaluating the models and generating the figures in the paper (https://github.com/atrautsch/icsme2020_replication).

A full combination of everything will be made available on Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.3974204) if the files do not need to changed anymore. The DOI will be referenced in the camera ready version.
