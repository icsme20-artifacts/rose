# Badges

We apply for both the **Available** and **Reusable** Badges.

We have offered permanent access at <https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/LPHCUS> to:

1. The software tool GenSlice and its usage instructions
1. The raw results from the experiments described in the paper
1. The replication package to obtain the experimental results 

We have provided a Docker image for easy reproduction of the experimental results and GenSlice
is documented and structured in a way to facilitate future extensions.

The GenSlice repository is also available on GitHub: <https://github.com/Chenguang-Zhu/icsme20-artifact>.
