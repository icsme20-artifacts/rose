## Artifact for ICSME'2020 paper 130 "Shake It! Detecting Flaky Tests Caused by Concurrency with Shaker"

SHAKER is a lightweight approach to detect flakiness in time-constrained tests by adding noise in the execution environment. 
The GitHub repository at https://github.com/shaker-project/shaker/ contains the toolset we developed, our flaky tests dataset, raw evaluation results, and scripts for performing data analysis.
